# Welcome

This knowledge base accompanies the `nn-core` neural network implementation. Use it as the starting point for deeper dives into the design, mathematics, and tooling that power the project.

## Quick Links

- [Project Overview](./project-overview) — big-picture goals and repository layout.
- [Approach and Design Principles](./approach) — rationale behind architectural choices.
- [Mathematical Foundations](./math-foundations) — the equations that the code implements.
- [Implementation Walkthrough](./implementation-details) — line-by-line mapping between formulas and Rust.
- [AI-Assisted Variant (`nn-core-library`)](./nn-core-library) — how the automated version differs from the canonical crate.
- [Usage and Experimentation Guide](./usage-guide) — hands-on instructions for running and extending the project.

If you're brand new to neural networks, start with the [Project Overview](./project-overview) and proceed in order. Otherwise, jump directly to the section that matches your current task.
